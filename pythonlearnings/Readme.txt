1. Project 1 is for the dice roll :
Initally we are importing an random module through which we will be able to import randomint numbers between the set values and this is the def function. 
then we are saying while this is true we are then taking the input from the user and also this input that we are taking and then setting a conditional loop to check if the value meets the condition. 

Then we are setting the max score and also checking the condition if you still want to roll a dice. 


2. Project2 is for a madlibs generator: 
This is to create a project with a sample story with few strings that inputs from user to create a story we can create multiple of them but this is a default story to which the strings replace provided by the user using the dict.
